WARNING (OSSHNL-325): Place master 'proj/inverter_adc/symbol' for instance 'I0'
has been modified since the last
extraction of its parent cellview
'proj/MUX21/schematic'.
Connectivity changes in the place master can cause
issues in the generated
netlist. To resolve such issues:
-Reextract the parent
cellview 'proj/MUX21/schematic' and regenerate the netlist. To avoid
multiple
Check and Save operations, use the Check Hierarchy form or the
schHiCheckHier
SKILL function to do a hierarchical check and save on the top
cell and then
generate the netlist.
-Ignore all connectivity checks for this place master by
specifying it to the
list of cellviews to be ignored using the
hnlUserIgnoreCVModifyList variable.
-Change the severity of modification errors
by setting the environment variable
simSymbolModifiedAction to 'ignore'.
However, this may ignore both connectivity
and non-connectivity changes, thereby
generating an incorrect netlist.
To avoid reporting of non-connectivity changes
after performing a hierarchical
check and save operation, set 'schematic'
'autoEquivalentConnectivityTime' to
't' in the .cdsenv file. After setting the
autoEquivalentConnectivityTime
variable, set simSymbolModifiedAction to 'error'
to receive reports of only
connectivity issues during netlisting.
The variable
simSymbolModifiedAction controls the severity of this message,
which can be
'ignore', 'warning', or 'error'.
